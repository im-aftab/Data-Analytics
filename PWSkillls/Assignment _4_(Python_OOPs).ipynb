        "  - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a class while restricting direct access to some of the class's components. Though Python does not enforce strict access control like some other languages, it uses conventions and name mangling for encapsulation:\n",

        "  - **Public members**: Variables and methods without any underscores are public and accessible from anywhere.\n",
        "\n",

        "  \n",
        "  - **Private members:** Prefixing with double underscores (__variable) makes the member private through name mangling, meaning it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Python internally changes the name to include the class name to prevent accidental access.\n",

        "Encapsulation is typically implemented in Python by:\n",
        "\n",

        "    \n",
        "    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) provides several key benefits that make it a popular paradigm in software development:\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Modularity\n",
        "        - OOP organizes code into discrete objects, which encapsulate data and behavior. This modular approach supports code clarity, easier debugging, and simpler maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Reusability\n",
        "        - Once a class is written, it can be reused in other programs or projects. Inheritance and polymorphism allow for easy extension and specialization of existing functionality, reducing code duplication.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Encapsulation\n",
        "        - By bundling data and methods that operate on that data within objects, OOP enforces access control and hides internal complexities. This improves data integrity and security, allowing developers to expose only necessary interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Maintainability\n",
        "        - Updating or fixing bugs is more manageable since changes are typically isolated within specific objects or classes. This localized modification minimizes risk to other parts of the codebase.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Scalability and Flexibility\n",
        "        - OOP's approach to organizing software allows for larger, more complex programs to be built incrementally. The use of objects makes it easier to introduce new features and adapt to changing requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Polymorphism\n",
        "        - Objects can be treated interchangeably through common interfaces, enabling flexible code that works with different types of objects without needing to know their concrete classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Code Reusability through Inheritance\n",
        "        - Classes can inherit traits from other classes, allowing fundamental attributes and behaviors to be defined once and shared among many derived classes.\n",

        "      - Inheritance:\n",

        "        - When you call this overridden method on an object, Python determines which version of the method to execute based on the actual type of the object, not just its declared type (if applicable). This means you can have a collection of objects of different, but related, types (e.g., a list of Animal objects where some are Dog and some are Cat), and call the same method (e.g., make_sound()) on all of them.
